For every additional element, why you are adding it: Adding additional servers and a load balancer to ensure high availability, load distribution, and redundancy.

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works: Round Robin, which alternates requests among available servers to evenly distribute the load.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both: Active-Active, where both servers handle requests simultaneously for load distribution and high availability; Active-Passive has one server on standby to take over if the active one fails.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works: The Primary node handles all write operations and replicates data to the Replica nodes, which handle read operations to reduce load on the Primary.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application: The Primary node processes write operations, while the Replica nodes handle read operations to balance the load and improve performance.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

If the load balancer fails, the entire system is down. Redundant load balancers can mitigate this risk.
Security Issues:

No firewall: The system is vulnerable to unauthorized access.
No HTTPS: Data transmission is not encrypted, making it susceptible to interception.
No Monitoring:

Without monitoring, itâ€™s difficult to detect issues in real-time, affecting the reliability and performance of the infrastructure.
