Explanation of Specific Elements
Why Adding Each Element:

Firewalls: Enhance security by controlling traffic between different parts of the infrastructure.
SSL Certificate: Serve encrypted traffic to protect data in transit.
Monitoring Clients: Enable tracking and analysis of server performance and health.
What Are Firewalls For:

Purpose: To block unauthorized access while permitting authorized communication.
Why Serve Traffic Over HTTPS:

Purpose: Encrypts data to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
What Monitoring Is Used For:

Purpose: To track server performance, detect anomalies, and ensure the infrastructure runs smoothly.
How the Monitoring Tool Collects Data:

Method: Monitoring clients gather data on metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic and send it to a centralized monitoring service.
Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second):

Steps:
Configure the monitoring client to track and report the number of HTTP requests per second.
Set up alerts and dashboards in the monitoring service to visualize QPS and detect anomalies.
Issues with This Infrastructure
Why Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level is an Issue:

Reason: SSL termination at the load balancer means internal traffic between the load balancer and web servers is unencrypted, which can be a security risk.
Why Having Only One MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes is an Issue:

Reason: It creates a single point of failure (SPOF) for write operations, leading to potential downtime if the primary server fails.
Why Having Servers with All the Same Components Might be a Problem:

Reason: Increases complexity and resource contention, making it harder to scale and maintain the infrastructure. Specialized roles (separate web, application, and database servers) are
